Look for news related to the AI coding industry. Anything on companies
like Cursor and Cognition, new open standards like AGENTS.md, news about Claude Code, etc.

(Don't specifically search for those keywords--look around generically for anything happening in the industry)

This should only be NEWS, like funding rounds, acquisitions, major launches, etc.

DO NOT include e.g. tutorials, best practices, or opinion pieces.
