*Note: Due to access restrictions on major platforms (Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, Substack, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Medium, Dev.to, Hacker News, arXiv, The Register, InfoQ, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, and most AI news sites), a comprehensive search could not be completed. No recent mentions of OpenHands (within the past week) were found in accessible sources.
