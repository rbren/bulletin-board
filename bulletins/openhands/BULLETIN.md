*Note: Due to access restrictions on major platforms (Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, Substack, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Medium, Dev.to, Hacker News search, arXiv, The Register, InfoQ, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, and most AI news sites), a comprehensive search could not be completed. No recent mentions of OpenHands (within the past month) were found in accessible sources. Previous Hacker News submissions from the OpenHands domain were found but are older than 1 month (49-64 days ago) and thus excluded from this bulletin.*
