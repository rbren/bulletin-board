*Note: Due to access restrictions on major platforms (Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, Substack, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Medium, Dev.to, Hacker News search, arXiv, The Register, InfoQ, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, and most AI news sites), a comprehensive search could not be completed. Only one recent mention of OpenHands (within the past month) was found in accessible sources. The article by Charles Azam describes how he accidentally rebuilt a multi-tenant AI coding agent framework similar to OpenHands, sharing insights about agent frameworks, costs, and architecture.*
