Look for mentions of the OpenHands project, e.g. on Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Substack,
and in the news in general. Look far and wide. If there's an interaction metric (e.g.
number of likes, stars, views, etc) record that as well.

DO NOT look at openhands.dev or official OpenHands communications. This is specifically about OpenHands being
mentioned organically in the wild

Look far and wide. Look at social media. Look at blogging sites. Look at YouTube.
