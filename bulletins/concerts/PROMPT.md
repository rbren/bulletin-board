Look for concerts in the Boston area. Only in Boston/Cambridge/Somerville--don't look outside that range.

I'm specifically interested in:
* Contemporary classical (e.g. Caroline Shaw, Philip Glass, So Percussion)
* Alt/indie rock (e.g. LCD Soundsystem, TV on the Radio, Modest Mouse)
* Anything experimental

Favorite venues include the Lilypad, Roadrunner, and the Sinclair

I live right by the Lilypad, so be sure to highlight the most interesting 1-2 shows that aren't part of their standard weekly lineup.
For the Lilypad, events are listed directly on https://www.lilypadinman.com/, don't use the calendar
